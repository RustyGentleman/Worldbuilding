### Inflectional morphemes - affixes used to conjugate verbs and decline nouns

Trial								-> Suffix -iyiyi
	* multiple additional -yi may be added, but will be taken as a vague description of quantity, or as hyperbole
Negative							-> Suffix na'-
Comparative (adj/adv)		-> Suffix -(a)he		(like -er in "bigger")
Superlative	(adj/adv)		-> Suffix -(u)heye	(like -est in "biggest")
Nominative (verb agent)		-> Suffix -(i)lan
Accusative (verb object)	-> Suffix -(e)sna
Genitive (owner of)			-> Suffix -(a)sye

	hileala, noun: likeness, resemblance; the fact or quality of being alike or similar
	hileala, verb: to resemble, to be like
	hile'ar, noun: manifested; given form
"Predator" prefix				-> Prefix rah- (from "rah", predator)
	The names of most predators or carnivorous animals start with this prefix, often followed by an onomatopeia of a sound they make, or some trait or short descriptor compound.
	I.e.: rah'ar, wolf/other canid; rah'yi, fox.
"Herbivore" prefix			-> Prefix rya-
	Like the "predator" prefix, this applies to the names of herbivores.

# Semantics - the study of meaning
## rah'ar -> rah -> -'ar
An example of reanalysis, the rise of new underlying relationships and rules in a grammar. _Rah'ar_, the word for _wolf_, gave rise to the word _rah_, for predator or, more generally, meat-eating animals. Then, through reanalysis, _-'ar_ was transformed into a morpheme that transforms a concept (in this case a category of animals) and transforms it into a thing (an animal that eats meat).
## (-)hile(-) -> hile
Another example of reanalysis. _(-)hile(-)_ started as a morpheme which is added to other morphemes to embody what they mean. Eventually, however, as it lacked meaning without other morphemes, it began to be used by itself with the meaning of "emptiness", or "absence of".

# Pragmatics - actual use, how meanings change in context
## Hierarchical honorifics
In elven communities, these titles immediately precede the name or pronoun of a given person. The first tree must agree in gender and plurality with the pronoun it precedes.
Child, young					-> nela
Unmarried, single				-> vela
Married							-> zena
Council member					-> doril
Coordinator						-> arvane

The following respect markers are applied to one's name or pronoun, and title, respectively
Nomial							-> Suffix -el
Titular							-> Suffix -nir
