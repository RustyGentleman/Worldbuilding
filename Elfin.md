# Semantics - the study of meaning
## rah'ar -> rah -> -'ar
An example of reanalysis, the rise of new underlying relationships and rules in a grammar. _Rah'ar_, the word for _wolf_, gave rise to the word _rah_, for predator or, more generally, meat-eating animals. Then, through reanalysis, _-'ar_ was transformed into a morpheme that transforms a concept (in this case a category of animals) and transforms it into a thing (an animal that eats meat).
## (-)hile(-) -> hile
Another example of reanalysis. _(-)hile(-)_ started as a morpheme which is added to other morphemes to embody what they mean. Eventually, however, as it lacked meaning without other morphemes, it began to be used by itself with the meaning of "emptiness", or "absence of".

# Pragmatics - actual use, how meanings change in context
## Hierarchical honorifics

Child, young					-> nela
Unmarried, single				-> vela
Married							-> zena

Councilor						-> doril
Coordinator						-> arvane

The following respect markers are applied to one's name or pronoun, and title, respectively
Nomial							-> Suffix -el
Titular							-> Suffix -nir
