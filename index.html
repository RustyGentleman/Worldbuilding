				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Ras is a male, two-tailed kitsune of a towering height of roughly 2m, or 6'8", and seemingly in his late twenties to early thirties, living in a cozy wooden house amidst the woods.</p>
					<p>He is quite a warmhearted and caring person, having a disarmingly calm and gentle demeanor, though he can be witty and playful when comfortable with his company. Though, being true to his kin, he is not above playing tricks on others and putting his silver tongue to use for his benefit, he is good at heart, rarely intending harm with his antics. This puts his alignment somewhere between Neutral Good and True Neutral.</p>

					<h1>Kitsunes</h1>
					<h2>Courteous Tricksters</h2>
				</header>
				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Kitsunes are a race of humanoid beings with of large, bushy tails and tall, furry ears atop their heads.</p>
					<p>Compared to humans, their joints and spines are more flexible, but also somewhat more prone to certain injuries. Other differences include claws in place of nails, often charcoal black toward the tip, a somewhat low sensitivity to sweetness, and a tendency towards having androgynous appearance, presumably so as to attract more types of prey.</p>
					<p>At the back of their eyes, in front of their retinas, lies a layer of reflective tissue, called the tapetum lucidum, allowing them to see better in the dark, as well as making their vertical pupils appear to shimmer against the light.</p>
					<p>They are born with a single tail, which splits into multiple over the course of their lives. The necessary conditions for this splitting to occur are still unclear even to them; while some attribute it to epistemological or spiritual enlightenment, others attribute it to expertise in magic, as their already-great magic capacity seems to increase each time they get a new tail.</p>
