					<h2>the Gentle Kitsune</h2>
				</header>
				<h1 section-id="overview">Overview</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Ras is a male, two-tailed kitsune of a towering height of roughly 2m, or 6'8", and seemingly in his late twenties to early thirties, living in a cozy wooden house amidst the woods.</p>
					<p>He is quite a warmhearted and caring person, having a disarmingly calm and gentle demeanor, though he can be witty and playful when comfortable with his company. Though, being true to his kin, he is not above playing tricks on others and putting his silver tongue to use for his benefit, he is good at heart, rarely intending harm with his antics. This puts his alignment somewhere between Neutral Good and True Neutral.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="names">Given & Family Names</h2>
				<section>
					<p>His given name is Ras, pronounced as [ɽɑs], although some may pronounce it closer to "Rasu", or [ɽɑsʉ]. Phonetically, the 'R' in his name is a tap or flap, rather than the English standard, which is a proximant.</p>
					<p>His family name, Silverleaf, indicates his family is originally from the Silverwood forests found in elven territory. That being so, it is not only possible but highly likely that he is some-part elf as well.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="sexuality">Sexuality</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Though saying he is heterosexual would be mostly true, it is not strictly so. It is fairer to say he is attracted to femininity; to soft, graceful forms, whether curvaceous or diminute.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="age">Age</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Despite his appearance, kitsunes age somewhat differently than humans. Although he's often hesitant to divulge his actual age, it's likely that he's in his mid thirties, or perhaps early fourties.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="appearance">Appearance</h1>
				<section>
					<p>His long, wavy hair is kept loose, reaching down to the small of his back. Were it not difficult for him to braid it himself, however, he would. The fur of his tails and ears are, like his hair, pure white in color and quite well-kept, especially for one who dwells in the woods, works the soil and does manual labor.</p>
					<p>His eyes are that of a predator; a deep, bright amber that almost seem to glow under the light of a fire, cut vertically by black slits which shimmer in the dark.</p>
					<p>His claws are, as is common, charcoal black at the tip, fading into clear translucent toward the base, where they fuse into his fingertips. They aid in climbing trees and moving through soft terrain when barefooted. They are not retractable, and, as such, are often worn and dulled from wear, though the ones on his feet often still require trimming - considering it quite a dull job, the less often he must make new boots, the better.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="physique">Physique</h2>
				<section>
					<p>He is exceptionally tall, at roughly 2m, or 6'7" - not counting his ears, which measure at 20cm, or 8", tall. A wiry physique comprised of lean, tough muscles supports it well, allowing him to be quite agile, considering his size.</p>
					<p>His form is mostly owed to the early years he spent doing manual labor at the nearby town, while, through part of it, simultaneously working on opening a clearing in the woods and building a home for himself. However, he only manages to keep his shape through chores, combat training and the occasional adventuring.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="garments">Garments</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Traditionally, kitsunes tend to wear kimonos, even at home, though some prefer wearing robes when in privacy. He can always be found wearing a simple, white kimono, which he owns a few of, and his dark blue obi. He does, however, own a more elaborately tailored kimono, as well as a white and black haori which doesn't get used often, as he usually finds enchanting his current apparel to be denser in cold weather sufficiently effective in all but winter.</p>
					<p>He walks in and near his home barefooted, but wears a pair of sturdy leather boots during longer trips, paired with a belt onto which he attaches the sheath of his blade, as well as pouches, when needed.</p>

					</span>
					<div>
						<b>Physical</b>
						<p><b class="physical">Towering</b> - He is exceptionally tall, measuring between 2 and 2.1 meters, or roughly 6'7" to 6'10". Though, thanks to his physique, this doesn't negatively impact his speed and agility, it does make it more difficult to find clothes that fit, or weapons that are appropriately sized.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<b>Magical</b>
						<p><b class="magical">Woodland Guardian</b> - He communes with the forest wherein he resides; the trees carry whispers to him of happenings throughout the forest, and may guide him towards anything of note.</p>
						<p><b class="magical">Foxfire</b> - His foxfire is a gentle, light blue hue close to cyan.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="skills">Skills</h1>
				<section class="subcolumns">
					<div>
						<b>Physical</b>
						<p><b class="physical">Swordsmanship</b> - He is respectably skilled in wielding swords of various types, having a preference for wielding them in one hand while favoring hilts that can accomodate a second hand. Most of his experience, however, is with Grace, a particularly long, double-edged sword crafted specifically for him</p>
						<p><b class="physical">Archery</b> - He is decently skilled at wielding bows, a skill taught by his father and which he hones by hunting. Though he does own a short compound bow, which he brings to adventures and other situations where he may expect confrontations, he often hunts with a longbow for training, which his physique and stature allow him some ease in wielding.</p>
						<p><b class="physical">Crafts</b> - He is adequately skilled in many crafts, out of both interest and necessity - living alone in the woods, the ability to transform raw materials into useful objects, apparel and furniture is indispensable. Such skills include carpentry, woodworking, leatherworking and tailoring, among others. He is quite fond of carving bones, horns, tusks and antlers into pendants and trinkets that often exalt the beauty, form and/or traits of the animal or creature they come from, considering it a way to express appreciation for them.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<b>Magical</b>
						<p><b class="magical">Enchanting</b> - He is exceptionally skilled in this form of emergent magic, which pertains to the ability to alter both the appearance and the physical properties of objects and matter. In fact, he is one of very few enchanters in history to successfully apply enchantments to living tissue, though he is unaware of this fact.</p>
						<p><b class="magical">Sense-weaving</b> - He is highly skilled in this form of emergent magic, more often called sensorial or sensory magic, which pertains to imposing simple sensory perceptions onto other beings, such as sights or sounds. One example of this is Voice Projection, wherein the caster can project their own voice to another's mind, and which he is so well-practiced in that it sometimes takes less effort than actually speaking. This form of magic is limited in scope, but can be quite useful.</p>
						<p><b class="magical">Illusionary Magic</b> - He is respectably skilled in this school of magic, which pertains to effects that change the perception of those who witness the effect itself or whatever object or entity it is cast upon. One example would be the spell that keeps others from finding Ras's home in the woods: when a being approaches a certain radius around it while having the intent of finding his home, it is made to either walk in circles or turn around unwittingly.</p>

				<h1 section-id="belongings">Notable Belongings</h1>
				<section>
					<p><b>'Grace'</b></p>
					<p>A fittingly-named, finely-crafted sword forged by a minotaur blacksmith, given to him as a gift in return for his assistance in a personal matter. It has a long and somewhat thin, double-edged blade that tapers to a fine point, similar to a rapier or an estoc, with a blade measuring about 100 centimeters (or about 40 inches) in length. It has a cruciform cross-guard, with ring guards on either side, and a hand-and-a-half hilt.</p>
					<p><b>Blue silk obi</b></p>
					<p>A dark blue obi made of fine silk which he always wears. It was given to him as a remembrance by his mother before he left to live alone. He was told it was gifted to them by another kitsune family, though by then the occasion for such a gift had escaped her mind.</p>
					<p><b>Embroidered white kimono</b></p>
					<p>An elaborately tailored kimono, white in color, with an embroidered pattern of leaves, also in white, resulting in a subtle but elegant look. It was made by a member of a family of talented kitsune craftsmen at his order, and cost a small fortune. He'll sometimes wear it at home while smoking and indulging himself on anything sweet he might have, though he'll also wear it out on the few rare occasions that warrant it.</p>
					<p><b>White & black haori</b></p>
					<p>A white, thigh-length haori, with a black lining painted in an elaborate bamboo leaf pattern, symbolizing calmness and tranquility. He doesn't use it often, and how he came into possession of it is unclear, though, given its style, it's likely he had it tailored specifically for him as well.</p>

					<p>Kitsunes are a race of humanoid beings with of large, bushy tails and tall, furry ears atop their heads.</p>
					<p>Compared to humans, their joints and spines are more flexible, but also somewhat more prone to certain injuries. Other differences include claws in place of nails, often charcoal black toward the tip, a somewhat low sensitivity to sweetness, and a tendency towards having androgynous appearance, presumably so as to attract more types of prey.</p>
					<p>At the back of their eyes, in front of their retinas, lies a layer of reflective tissue, called the tapetum lucidum, allowing them to see better in the dark, as well as making their vertical pupils appear to shimmer against the light.</p>
					<p>They are born with a single tail, which splits into multiple over the course of their lives. The necessary conditions for this splitting to occur are still unclear even to them; while some attribute it to epistemological or spiritual enlightenment, others attribute it to expertise in magic, as their already-great magic capacity seems to increase each time they get a new tail.</p>
