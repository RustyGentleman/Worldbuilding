				</header>
				<section>
					<p>Yet Unnamed is a worldbuilding and writing project set in a medieval-era fantasy world. It was born from a continual development of the character <a page-link="ras">Ras Silverleaf</a>, his home and the surrounding area, and, as such, its development is being done 'from inside out', so to say.</p>
					<p>Though this organic manner of development - and, indeed, the creation of this project - was unintended, I, as a writer, enjoy the idea that each fact, item, being or idea is to be moreso discovered or inferred than purely invented on a whim.</p>

				<h1 section-id="overview">Overview</h1>
				<section>
					<p>The Whisperwood Forest is a large, thickly forested region, comprised of a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees. It is named after the Whisperwood Oak, a rather intriguing species endemic to it - meaning it only exists here.</p>
					<p>Its climate is cold, but not boreal, with fairly temperate summers and springs, cold falls and frigid winters. Though its coastal areas see a fair bit of rain during summers and springs, rainfall diminishes towards more inland areas, some of which may only see rain during the summer.</p>
					<p>A number of villages and small towns dot the region, their formation and survival predominantly owed to forestry, hunting and clay extraction, but also, in smaller part, to animal husbandry. Trade also plays an important role in the increasing growth of these settlements, due to the traffic of people and goods to and from [the large coastal city], a large city in the south coast.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="flora">Flora</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Its size and fertile soil contribute to a fairly large diversity of plants and fungi, while its climate allows for a significant variety of types and species of trees, as well, being home to both deciduous and evergreen trees.</p>
					<p>Below are some notable mentions.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="whisperwood">Whisperwood Oak</h2>
				<section>
					<p>A species of oak known to grow only in this region. While structurally similar to other species of oak, it has a tendency to exhibit various forms of symmetry in the way its branches and leaves grow.</p>
					<p>Its leaves are green during spring and summer, and progressively turn light yellow, orange, and then red during fall, to then turn a dark crimson come winter. Though the tree is deciduous, it retains large part of its leaves throughout winter.</p>
					<p>Its most interesting trait, however, is the growth of thin, stem-like modified leaves along its branches that are able to perform elaborate gestures. Though other types of trees and plants are known to have flowers or leaves that move, the mechanism through which these gestures are activated is unknown, a small number of different gestures have been recorded.</p>
					<p>During spring and early summer, when its flowers blossom, these modified leaves perform a series of gestures throughout the day that generate winds in an upward and outward direction, which spreads pollen towards neighboring trees and up into stronger natural air currents.</p>
					<p>Other series have been recorded, though their patterns or objectives have so far been elusive. Some of them have been known to generate winds as well, but also whistling, howling and murmuring sounds, which give the region its name.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="fluffberry">Fluffberry</h2>
				<section>
					<p>A very common berry, found in most temperate and cold regions in the continent. They are amber in color and of lobular, lumpy shape, which lends them the colloquial name of <i>'cloudberries'</i>. They grow from shrubs that range in size from that of a bush to the size of a small tree, though they are generally about the height of a person.</p>
					<p>The reason for its proper name, and another reason for its colloquial name, is the fact that it is quite airy on the inside, with vacuoles, or bubbles, of air. Despite this, it still is juicy and sweet, which, together with its light weight, lends well to its dispersal mechanism: once the berries have grown and matured, they detach from the plant and float in the air to be carried away by winds and/or eaten by birds, both of which help it spread further.</p>
					<p>Due to its highly effective seed dispersal, it is considered invasive in some regions, though it is also farmed in some places.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="fauna">Fauna</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Hares and deer, as well as small arboreal mammals and some species of rodents, are the most prevalent, being seen in nearly all areas of the region. A variety of amphibians like frogs and salamanders can be seen in wetter regions and near lakes and rivers, where insects are more often seen as well.</p>
					<p>Its predatory population mostly comes down to boars, which appear in the entire region, some species of wolves, which only appear in certain areas, bears and foxes, which will wander in from surrounding regions during fall and winter, and birds of prey.</p>
					<p>Herbives and omnivores seem to thrive particularly well in most areas of the region. Popular local belief attributes it partly to the gestures and sounds that whisperwood oaks produce, though the presence of certain animal species certainly plays a part as well.</p>
				</section>
				<!-- <h2 section-id="whisperwood-ants">Whisperwood Ants</h2>
				<section>
					<p>A species of ant that is thought to have a symbiotic relationship with whisperwood oaks, being, as such, endemic to the region.</p>

						<span style="margin-bottom: -1.4rem;">Magic</span>
						<span>System</span>
						<h2>Mana & the Veil</h2>
					</h1>
				</header>
				<h1 section-id="overview">Overview</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Magic is as much inherent to the world as gravity in, existing in the form of an extra layer of reality, called the Veil. A form of energy called Mana permeates this layer, only interacting with physical reality and other forces in particular ways.</p>
					<p>Mana is thought to behave much like a gas or liquid, having a tendency to spread evenly throughout space when attractors and repellents aren't present. However, a variety of experiments can demonstrate that the concentration of mana in a given location does not change instantly, and, in fact, occurs somewhat slowly, generally in the span of dozens of minutes.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="mechanics">Mechanics</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Mana is naturally attracted to different substances, structures and patterns. It is theorized that it can also be repelled, though nothing has been found in nature so far that it is repelled by.</p>
					<p>Generally, mana is attracted to highly ordered structures and patterns, such as crystals and pure metals, as well as living creatures and certain substances. The attraction effect of highly ordered structures is proportionate to how low its entropy is - how regular and predictable its patterns are, and how many patterns the structure forms. This effect also scales with physical size, but not linearly.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="life&theveil">Life & the Veil</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Living things - animals, plants and even fungi - all seem to interact with the Veil in a particular way. Namely, it is thought that they form wells in the structure of the veil, which mana from the surrounding environment will naturally flow towards until filled. In the same manner, mana will spill from an overfilled well into the surrounding environment.</p>
					<p>As a small side note, some respected scholars theorize that structures and objects that strongly attract mana - collectively called <a section-link="accumulators">mana accumulators</a> - also cause a similar, but much lesser effect, forming divets in the structure of the veil, rather than deep wells.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="capacity">Capacity</h2>
				<section>
					<p>The capacity of a living thing's mana well depends on a variety of factors, among which the most important are complexity, species and race. Plants and fungi, which are generally considered to be the simplest forms of life, generally have less capacity than animals, while animals generally have less capacity than sapient beings.</p>
					<p>This is not always true, however, as species of plants that have evolved to make more effective use of magic may have a larger capacity than some animals, and so on, and different species of animals and sapient beings may have wildly different capacities. Additionally, capacity also varies between individuals of the same species, and can also be naturally expanded, to a degree, through training.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="accumulators">Mana Accumulators</h2>
				<section>
					<p>While objects and materials that attract mana will form a small region of higher mana concentration around them, when one of such objects is in motion, the mana in its area of influence is often unable to keep up with it, left behind in the form of a trail. The faster the object is moved, the faster mana leeches off of it.</p>
					<p>However, through rituals, it is possible to cause objects to form a dimple in the Veil - similar to the well a living thing forms, but much shallower. An object that has been altered in this manner is then called a mana accumulator, as the formation of this dimple alleviates much, though not all, of the aforementioned leeching effect, allowing it to hold onto mana.</p>
					<p>Objects that do not naturally attract mana can also be turned into mana accumulators. However, they accumulate mana much more slowly, and are often only used for storage or as <a section-link="spellproxies">spell proxies</a>.</p>
					<p>Many cultures that make significant use of magic and have access to mana-attracting materials have independently developed rituals that can produce mana accumulators, though different rituals produce different qualities of mana accumulators.</p>
					<p>Mana can be transferred to and from an accumulator with fairly little training, while the mana in mana-attracting objects cannot be tapped into. The reason for this is not yet fully understood, but the widely accepted theory is that such transferrence is only possible between depressions in the Veil - while mana can't be forced to flow between the environment and a depression, it can be forced to flow between depressions.</p>
					<p>Through use of theorized materials or substances that repel mana, it would be possible to produce much more effective and efficient mana accumulators.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="effects&spellcasting">Effects & Spellcasting</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Mana can be coaxed into exerting influence upon the physical world, such as manifesting as other forms of energy. Different forms of mana-to-energy conversion vary wildly in efficiency, however - mana can be converted to heat or light quite readily in small to medium amounts, while converting mana into motion is incredibly difficult. It can also be made to <a section-link="conjuring">manifest in physical form</a> by highly adept scholars.</p>
					<p>There are a few known methods through which one may draw on mana to perform magical effects or spells.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="structural">Structurally Induced</h2>
				<section>
					<p>In the same manner that ordered structures can attract mana, they can be constructed, drawn, grown or formed in such a way that they passively produce magical effects. However, due to the exponentially increasing complexity required for anything beyond very simple effects, this is of limited usefulness.</p>
					<p>Some of the most avant-garde scholars do theorize, however, that, with enough research and advancements, it may eventually be possible to construct massive, highly complex structures that overcome this limitation and supersede the capacity of individuals and groups of casters. Most of them fear the implications of this possibility.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="gesture&verbal">Gesture & Verbal Casting</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Gesture casting is the production of magical effects through series of motions, <!--usually performed by dedicated structures or limbs, -->while verbal casting is the production of magical effects through the production of series of sounds. While complexity is still a limiting factor, gestures and sounds can form patterns in time, as well as in space, which make these forms of spellcasting much more versatile and powerful.</p>
					<p>Both gesture and verbal casting depend on the same principle. Patterns of motion can coax mana into exerting influence upon the physical world, such as manifesting as other forms of energy. Different forms of mana-to-energy conversion vary wildly in efficiency, however - mana can be converted to heat or light quite readily in small to medium amounts, while converting mana into motion is incredibly difficult.</p>
				</section>
				<h3 section-id="differences">Differences</h3>
				<section>
					<p>While gesture and verbal casting function upon the same principles, they do differ from each other in ease and cost.</p>
					<p>Gestures can be surprisingly complex and elaborate, with spells of higher complexity requiring high dexterity and, sometimes, flexibility, though simpler spells can still be produced quite quickly, and can often be adapted to be performed with one's tail or body.</p>
					<p>Verbal casting, on the other hand, is much more flexible, as the same spell can be produced by different series of sounds, in the form of words, phrases, poems or even songs. This flexibility, however, is not without cost, as verbal casting requires a higher degree of mental focus, as well as generally taking longer.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="dancerituals">Dance Rituals</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Many cultures develop, at early stages of magic adoption, ritualistic dances that are performed in groups, usually during certain days of the year or in preparation for battle. These ritualistic performances are essentially a form of spellcasting akin to gesture and verbal casting, but performed by one's entire body.</p>
					<p>The prevalence of this development is attributed to the idea that, by involving multiple casters in a spell, the detrimental effect of lack of practice or ability in some of the individuals is alleviated. In essence, a few bad dancers in a group may not impede the spellcasting process.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="will">Will Projection</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Will projection is regarded as the most powerful, and, paradoxically, perhaps the most simple form of spellcasting. However, it is strongly reliant on both the caster's mental acuity and their knowledge on the particulars of both the spell itself and its resulting effect, else the spell will either simply fail or produce the wrong effect, which is often undesired.</p>
					<p>For example, for an appropriately adept scholar to cast a healing spell to close a wound through will projection, they must have sufficient knowledge of the wound in question, what tissues are affected and how, and the nature of the affected tissues, as well as, in some cases, what caused the wound.</p>
					<p>Effects that are highly complex to cast in other ways may be trivial to cast by will projection, and many effects are complex enough in their simplest forms that one can only be reasonably expected to cast them in this form.</p>
					<p>There is one limitation, however. Naturally, the more complex an effect is, the shorter the range at which it may be cast or projected. In will projection, however, this effect is much more pronounced, and many effects that can be cast at short to medium distances via gesture or verbal casting may only be cast in touch range or by direct touch.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="spellproxies">Spell Proxies</h1>
				<section>
					<p><a section-link="accumulators">Mana accumulators</a> can be imprinted with a spell or magic effect, to be triggered in a given condition, in response to a given event, or at a given interval. The spell, along with instructions and necessary information, is imprinted upon the accumulator by performing something akin to a ritual. Upon completion of this process, the accumulator then becomes a spell proxy.</p>
					<p>The amount of mana a proxy will spend when triggering a spell depends not only on the complexity of the spell, but also on the complexity of its instructions. It may also passively expend small amounts of mana to essentially check whether certain present conditions are met.</p>
					<p>A proxy will draw mana from its own reserves to perform the spell imprinted upon it. If its reserves are insufficient, however, the spell may only trigger partially, cease midway through, or simply not trigger.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="conjuring">Mana Conjuring</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Mana itself can be forced to manifest in physical form. With few exceptions, this usually requires both a high degree of proficiency and a very intimate understanding of the nature of mana and the Veil. As such, it is understood that only sapient beings can conjure mana itself in this way, though some scholars challenge this idea.</p>
					<p>Conjuring mana in this way has interesting effects. A person who touches an individual's mana may get impressions of their current emotions, or even feel them directly. In some cases, it is also possible to reach a more intimate understanding of the conjurer's being, if both persons involved already share a relationship that facilitates it.</p>
					<p>Due to this effect, it is widely believed that the <a page-link="kitsunes" section="foxfire">foxfire</a> of kitsunes is comprised, at least partially, by mana. Only a limited amount of study has been conducted in this matter, however.</p>

				<h1 section-id="overview">Overview</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Due to the large variety of spells and magical effects that can be achieved by drawing upon mana, scholars have, over time, divided these practices into separate schools of practice - 'school', in this case, referring to a group of people who share the same or similar ideas, styles or methods.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="conjuration">Conjuration</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Conjuration pertains to the act of making mana manifest itself in the world. Though it is a broad description, it usually refers to mana-to-energy conversion, though it is also used to refer to <a page-link="magicsystem" section="conjuring">mana conjuring</a>.</p>
					<p>As it includes the production of fire and light, in various forms, it is highly regarded as the most versatile and utilitarian form of magic, often being among the first to be development in any given culture.</p>
					<p>Being such a wide-ranging school of magic, spells that fall under its umbrella vary from the simple conjuration of light-emitting</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="senseweaving">Senseweaving</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Also known by other names, such as sensory or sensorial magic, it pertains to producing and imparting sensory stimuli onto other beings. While it isn't considered a difficult school of magic, it does require some knowledge of such sensory stimuli, as well as the ability of abstraction. As such, some individuals may struggle with it, while others may excel.</p>
					<p>The details on the mechanics of how senseweaving actually works is somewhat debated. While the production of stimulus clearly depends on the caster's ability to mentally produce said stimulus and to focus on projecting it, what affects a recipient's ability to receive and process the projected stimulus is ambiguous. In some cases, projecting auditory stimuli toward a deaf person succeeds in allowing them to hear, while in others it fails. The same seems to be true with other stimuli where this has been tested.</p>

					<h1>The Elven Empire</h1>
					<h2>Aegides of Nature</h2>
				</header>
				<h1 section-id="overview">Overview</h1>
				<section>
					<p>A powerful, decentralized empire formed by a pre-existing group of allied races, the central constituent being the Ley'iyish, or the Elves, which lends its name.</p>
					<p>Though it is multiracial in nature, it is bound by a strong kinship, which the Ley'iyish have fostered over their history, which, along with the expansion of their territory and influence, led to the empire's formation.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="structure">Governance Structure</h1>
				<section>
					<p>The empire is loosely-structured, with no single individual or entity in power. Instead, its power is distributed over a number of communities, each governed by a council consisting of some of the most intellectual and politically-inclined residents, one of which is appointed head of the council. This structure allows for a great deal of autonomy and flexibility in decision-making, with each council tending to its own community's goals and interests.</p>
					<p>Decisions and disputes in a community are discussed in gatherings where members are usually allowed to participate, though more delicate matters are tended to in privacy. This allows for all members of the community to have their words heard in matters that affect them, and for councilors to draw from different opinions and perspectives to base their decisions.</p>
					<p>The heads councilors of communities in a given area congregate periodically to share information and coordinate among themselves, though urgent and critical information can be, and often is, disseminated by small parties of messengers.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="society">Society</h1>
				<section>
					<p>To members of the empire, one's gender and race are irrelevant to their worth, and every individual's contribution is valued regardless. Family units are not strictly defined, most individuals following what their own racial traditions dictate, though the prominence of elves in the society means some adopt their family structure. In either case, however, the community as a whole still generally takes part in raising and educating the children of its constituting families.</p>
					<p>Despite this egalitarian attitude, the strong kinship between its constituent races and the elves does impact the values and views of the empire's society, especially regarding races, communities and individuals that exploit and endanger natural environments and the flora and fauna therein. Such outsiders are usually met with distrust and apprehension, and communities that encroach on the empire's territory are often met with resistance.</p>
					<p>Though there are a fair share of disputes and conflicts with outsiders, some communities bordering the empire's territory do have neutral, and even friendly relations with the empire, usually in the form of trade, diplomatic relations and treaties regarding the use and extraction of natural resources.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="military&tactics">Military & Tactics</h1>
				<section>
					<p>The decentralized nature of the empire is reflected on its military, with groups of nearby communities along the empire's borders coordinating their resources and manpower together to defend themselves against encroachment and small to medium forces. Against larger forces, however, they are able to quickly amass a considerable number of troops from communities further away in relatively short time. To an attacker, this makes it difficult to accurately assess and quantify the military power available to any single community, which in itself is a deterrent.</p>
					<p>Differently than councils, which preside over a single community, military tacticians and leaders have a number of communities under their jurisdiction and command, though soldiers themselves are trained locally or at the nearest community with appropriately skilled trainers. They are appointed by the collective opinions of the councils in the area, based on their knowledge of tactics and experience in battle.</p>
					<p>They employ guerrilla tactics to great effect in both defensive and offensive positions, capitalizing on their knowledge of the terrain and their ease of movement through a variety of natural terrains to create traps and hidden pits, which serve well in deterring encroaching parties and slowing down and demoralizing enemy forces. Ambushes are also employed heavily, especially in wooded areas and where they meet lower terrain, where elves especially, pure or hybrid, can make use of their <a page-link="elves" section="traits&abilities">longsight</a> launch surprise attacks from great distances.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="arms&equipment">Arms & Equipment</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Despite limited availability of metal, nearly all of it coming from trade and consisting of goods, the elves' <a page-link="elves" section="traits&abilities">woodforming</a> abilities and their intimate knowledge of wood as a material allow for the creation of very effective and precisely crafted weapons, especially bows and blunt weapons. Particularly skilled woodformers are even able to craft effective bladed weapons and arrowheads out of wood, though bone and stone is more widely used for those purposes.</p>
					<p>Perhaps the staple of the empire's arsenal, however, is the <i>core staff</i>, a weapon-tool "hybrid" similar to a quarterstaff, though thicker, and fitted with a chunk of crystalline material from the core of a Silverwood tree at one end. As well as being used in a traditional form of <a page-link="magicsystem" section="effects&spellcasting">spellcasting</a> that combines gestural and verbal components, these can be easily adapted by woodformers to serve as a variety of weapons or tools, from spears and scythes to hoes and axes. For this purpose, military troops are always appointed at least one properly skilled woodformer.</p>

				<h1 section-id="overview">Overview</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Ras is a male, two-tailed <a page-link="kitsunes">kitsune</a> with <a page-link="elves">elven</a> ancestry. He stands at a towering height of roughly two meters, or 6'8". Though he <a page-link="kitsunes" section="age"><i>looks</i></a> to be in the mid to late twenties, in reality, he's in the mid thirties. He lives alone in the <a page-link="whisperwood-forest">Whisperwood Forest</a>, in a wooden house he built himself.</p>
					<p>Though saying he is heterosexual would be mostly true, it is not strictly so. It is fairer to say he is attracted to femininity; to soft, graceful forms, whether curvaceous or diminute.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="name&family">Name & Family</h2>
				<section>
					<p>His given name is <i>Ras</i>, although some may pronounce it closer to <i>"Rasu"</i>, which is also acceptable. Phonetically, the 'R' in his name is a tap, not a proximant, as it is in English.</p>
					<p>The family name Silverleaf harkens back to the family's origin in elven territory, where Silverwood trees grow. Due to their proximity and relations with elves and other races under the <a page-link="elves" section="empire">elven empire</a>, members of this family tend to have close ties with nature. Intermingling with elves also resulted in them generally having pale skin and light hair, as well as slightly longer ears, in comparison to other kitsunes. Indeed, this does mean that Ras does have elven ancestry.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="personality">Personality</h1>
				<section>
					<p>His personality is both outwardly and inwardly marked by contrast. On the outside, the predatory traits of his kin contrast much with his disarmingly calm and gentle demeanor, though his more playful and witty side does show in trusted company, and sometimes even with strangers. On the inside, his wit and playfulness, along with his pleasure-seeking tendencies, contrast with his warmhearted and caring personality and his introvertedness.</p>
					<p>On the same coin, while he does act on his kin's innate desires, playing tricks and pranks on those that venture into the woods or even pass by the nearby road, he will also readily rescue and nurture those upon whom danger befalls - which, sadly, happens fairly often, especially during fall and winter.</p>
					<p>He is also not above doing things for his own benefit, even if it causes some inconvenience to others, but especially if it causes an inconvenience</p>
					<p>Altogether, his alignment falls between <i>True Neutral</i> and <i>Neutral Good</i></p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="appearance">Appearance</h1>
				<section>
					<p>His long, wavy hair is kept loose, reaching down to the small of his back. Were it not difficult for him to braid it himself, however, he would. The fur of his tails and ears are, like his hair, pure white in color and quite well-kept, especially for one who dwells in the woods, works the soil and does manual labor.</p>
					<p>His eyes are that of a predator; a deep, bright amber that almost seem to glow under the light of a fire, cut vertically by black slits which shimmer in the dark.</p>
					<p>His claws are, as is common, charcoal black at the tip, fading into clear translucent toward the base, where they fuse into his fingertips. They aid in climbing trees and moving through soft terrain when barefooted. They are not retractable, and, as such, are often worn and dulled from wear, though the ones on his feet often still require trimming - considering it quite a dull job, the less often he must make new boots, the better.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="physique">Physique</h2>
				<section>
					<p>He is exceptionally tall, at roughly 2m, or 6'7" - not counting his ears, which measure at 20cm, or 8", tall. A wiry physique comprised of lean, tough muscles supports it well, allowing him to be quite agile, considering his size.</p>
					<p>His form is mostly owed to the early years he spent doing manual labor at the nearby town, while, through part of it, simultaneously working on opening a clearing in the woods and building a home for himself. However, he only manages to keep his shape through chores, combat training and the occasional adventuring.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="garments">Garments</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Traditionally, kitsunes tend to wear kimonos, even at home, though some prefer wearing robes when in privacy. He can always be found wearing a simple, white kimono, which he owns a few of, and his dark blue obi. He does, however, own a more elaborately tailored kimono, as well as a white and black haori which doesn't get used often, as he usually finds enchanting his current apparel to be denser in cold weather sufficiently effective in all but winter.</p>
					<p>He walks in and near his home barefooted, but wears a pair of sturdy leather boots during longer trips, paired with a belt onto which he attaches the sheath of his blade, as well as pouches, when needed.</p>

					</span>
					<div>
						<b>Physical</b>
						<p><b class="physical">Towering</b> - He is exceptionally tall, measuring between 2 and 2.1 meters, or roughly 6'7" to 6'10". Though, thanks to his physique, this doesn't negatively impact his speed and agility, it does make it more difficult to find clothes that fit, or weapons that are appropriately sized.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<b>Magical</b>
						<p><b class="magical">Woodland Guardian</b> - He communes with the forest wherein he resides; the trees carry whispers to him of happenings throughout the forest, and may guide him towards anything of note.</p>
						<p><b class="magical">Foxfire</b> - His foxfire is a gentle, light blue hue close to cyan.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="skills">Skills</h1>
				<section class="subcolumns">
					<div>
						<b>Physical</b>
						<p><b class="physical">Swordsmanship</b> - He is respectably skilled in wielding swords of various types, having a preference for wielding them in one hand while favoring hilts that can accomodate a second hand. Most of his experience, however, is with Grace, a particularly long, double-edged sword crafted specifically for him</p>
						<p><b class="physical">Archery</b> - He is decently skilled at wielding bows, a skill taught by his father and which he hones by hunting. Though he does own a short compound bow, which he brings to adventures and other situations where he may expect confrontations, he often hunts with a longbow for training, which his physique and stature allow him some ease in wielding.</p>
						<p><b class="physical">Crafts</b> - He is adequately skilled in many crafts, out of both interest and necessity - living alone in the woods, the ability to transform raw materials into useful objects, apparel and furniture is indispensable. Such skills include carpentry, woodworking, leatherworking and tailoring, among others. He is quite fond of carving bones, horns, tusks and antlers into pendants and trinkets that often exalt the beauty, form and/or traits of the animal or creature they come from, considering it a way to express appreciation for them.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<b>Magical</b>
						<p><b class="magical">Enchanting</b> - He is exceptionally skilled in this form of emergent magic, which pertains to the ability to alter both the appearance and the physical properties of objects and matter. In fact, he is one of very few enchanters in history to successfully apply enchantments to living tissue, though he is unaware of this fact.</p>
						<p><b class="magical">Sense-weaving</b> - He is highly skilled in this form of emergent magic, more often called sensorial or sensory magic, which pertains to imposing simple sensory perceptions onto other beings, such as sights or sounds. One example of this is Voice Projection, wherein the caster can project their own voice to another's mind, and which he is so well-practiced in that it sometimes takes less effort than actually speaking. This form of magic is limited in scope, but can be quite useful.</p>
						<p><b class="magical">Illusionary Magic</b> - He is respectably skilled in this school of magic, which pertains to effects that change the perception of those who witness the effect itself or whatever object or entity it is cast upon. One example would be the spell that keeps others from finding Ras' home in the woods: when a being approaches a certain radius around it while having the intent of finding his home, it is made to either walk in circles or turn around unwittingly.</p>

				</section>
				<h1 section-id="belongings">Notable Belongings</h1>
				<section>
					<p><b>'Grace'</b></p>
					<p>A fittingly-named, finely-crafted sword forged by a minotaur blacksmith, given to him as a gift in return for his assistance in a personal matter. It has a long and somewhat thin, double-edged blade that tapers to a fine point, similar to a rapier or an estoc, with a blade measuring about 100 centimeters (or about 40 inches) in length. It has a cruciform cross-guard, with ring guards on either side, and a hand-and-a-half hilt.</p>
					<p><b>Blue silk obi</b></p>
					<p>A dark blue obi made of fine silk which he always wears. It was given to him as a remembrance by his mother before he left to live alone. He was told it was gifted to them by another kitsune family, though by then the occasion for such a gift had escaped her mind.</p>
					<p><b>Embroidered white kimono</b></p>
					<p>An elaborately tailored kimono, white in color, with an embroidered pattern of leaves, also in white, resulting in a subtle but elegant look. It was made by a member of a family of talented kitsune craftsmen at his order, and cost a small fortune. He'll sometimes wear it at home while smoking and indulging himself on anything sweet he might have, though he'll also wear it out on the few rare occasions that warrant it.</p>
					<p><b>White & black haori</b></p>
					<p>A white, thigh-length haori, with a black lining painted in an elaborate bamboo leaf pattern, symbolizing calmness and tranquility. He doesn't use it often, and how he came into possession of it is unclear, though, given its style, it's likely he had it tailored specifically for him as well.</p>

					<h1 translate="no">Kitsunes</h1>
					<h2>Courteous Tricksters</h2>
				</header>
				<h1 section-id="overview">Overview</h1>
				<section>
					<p>A race of humanoid beings with of large, bushy tails and tall, furry ears atop their heads.</p>
					<p>Compared to humans, their joints and spines are more flexible, but also somewhat more prone to certain injuries. Other differences include claws in place of nails, often charcoal black toward the tip, a somewhat low sensitivity to sweetness, and a tendency towards having androgynous appearance, presumably so as to attract more types of prey.</p>
					<p>At the back of their eyes, in front of their retinas, lies a layer of reflective tissue, called the tapetum lucidum, allowing them to see better in the dark, as well as making their vertical pupils appear to shimmer against the light.</p>
					<p>They are born with a single tail, which splits into multiple over the course of their lives. The necessary conditions for this splitting to occur are still unclear even to them; while some attribute it to epistemological or spiritual enlightenment, others attribute it to expertise in magic, as their already-great magic capacity seems to increase each time they get a new tail.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="culture">Culture</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Not much is known of their culture; as a race, they tend to keep to themselves, and as individuals, they often avoid subjects involving their kin. Furthermore, of those who know more than what may be considered common knowledge, most are scholars, experienced adventurers and/or individuals who are acquainted with or otherwise have relations with them.</p>
					<p>Most well known are their hunting habits, as they'll sometimes prey upon other humanoid or sapient races, with intent ranging from sport, mischief and entertainment, to attaining or earning servants and mates. Though most would consider this evil and immoral, they often consider it little more than a fun, engaging and rewarding activity. Such hunts rarely result in injuries, and those who fall prey usually enjoy the ordeal, for one reason or another - and, aside from those who are taken as servants and mates, return to their lives as normal, sometimes not even remembering the hunt.</p>
					<p>Knowledge of their family gatherings is only fairly well known due to being one of very few events wherein outsiders are welcomed, and even then, only those who have earned a kitsune's favor, companionship or trust. It is said that, in such events, even dwarves may find themselves strongly inebriated</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="age">Age</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Despite his appearance, kitsunes age somewhat differently than humans. Although he's often hesitant to divulge his actual age, it's likely that he's in his mid thirties, or perhaps early fourties.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="traits&abilities">Traits & Abilities</h1>
				<section class="subcolumns">
					<div>
						<b class="title">Physical</b>
						<p><b>Prehensile Tails</b> - Their tails tails are prehensile, and can be used to push, pull and grasp objects. As their mass of furs makes them functionally akin to an enormous thumb, they're not well suited to manipulating delicate or small objects. They do, however, serve very well as paddles for swimming.</p>
						<p><b>Dimsight</b> - Their vision in low-light conditions is improved by the presence of a <i>tapetum lucidum</i> in front of their retinas. They don't, however, see perfectly well in such conditions, or see at all in complete absence of light.</p>
						<p><b>Predatory Instincts</b> - Being a predatory species, their alertness is always on a hair-trigger; they can become very alert at the slightest stimulus, and tend to be very perceptive. That's not to say they are constantly in fight-or-flight, however - it is simply natural to them. It does, however, make it fairly difficult to catch one off-guard.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<b class="title">Magical</b>
						<p><b>Magic Affinity</b> - Magic comes quite naturally to them, in both understanding and execution, unlike with dragonkins, to whom only the execution comes effortlessly. Consequently, kitsunes are amongst the most innovative and versatile mages there are. Though not all dedicate themselves to the study of its workings, nearly all have some level of knowledge or practice, even if only for convenience.</p>
						<p><b>Foxfire</b> - The name given to their ability to conjure special magic flames, as well as to the flames themselves. These flames and its effects are unique to their race, and can be used as lighting and even as spell proxies, but they are primarily used for hunting prey.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="foxfire">Foxfire</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Perhaps their most important racial trait and ability, these flames differ visually from normal fire in that they move much more slowly, as though they are viscous or semisolid - as if there is substance to them. They also differ in color per individual, though most come in cool colors. This dominance may be explained by the fact that warm colors may agitate potential prey, thus being selected against.</p>
					<p>Used as the primary means for hunting, these flames incite not heat - they only feel comfortingly warm - but lust and desire, the effects increasing with amount and length of exposure. Prolonged exposure can even induce intrusive thoughts of submission. Kitsunes themselves are impervious to this effect, however; instead, contact with the foxfire of another kitsune can convey vague impressions of its conjurer's thoughts and emotions, and is considered a form of bonding. Such bonding is also possible with those of other species, although it requires mental discipline on the conjurer's part, as it falls on them to alter the effects of their foxfire; the other party, however, cannot reciprocate - this then becomes an expression of trust.</p>
					<p>Foxfire is often also used as lighting, and, behaving as an extension of its conjurer, can be used as a proxy for contact spells and as an anchor for other types of spells.</p>

					<h1>Elves</h1>
					<h2>Archons of Nature</h2>
				</header>
				<h1 section-id="overview">Overview</h1>
				<section>
					<p>The most prevalent subrace of elfins, which are a group of races characterized by long, pointy ears, a strong bond with nature and above-average affinity for magic. They have pale skin and their hairs range from white and blonde to light brown. Though other elfins tend to be fairly similar, those that live in deserts can have tan or even dark skin, with hair ranging from brown to black and even ginger.</p>
					<p>They call themselves <i>ley'iyish</i>, which means <i>'born from silver'</i>, relating to their <a section-link="creationmyth">creation myth</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="culture">Culture</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Elves generally believe they are the "original" elfins, from which other subraces differentiated, which is likely to be at least partially true, as some elfins bear strong resemblance with elves. Some of the other elfin subraces don't consider themselves to be from the same culture, however, and challenge this belief.</p>
					<p>Though they tend to be very xenophobic, this only extends toward races and individuals that aren't attuned with nature, especially if such individuals are elfins. This also extends, though to a much lesser degree, to elfins that have lost their pale complexion.</p>
					<p>Those cases aside, they are very welcoming toward other races, some communities even embracing those of other cultures that wish to study theirs or to attune themselves with nature. This, over time, has formed a strong kinship between elves and other forest-dwelling races, eventually giving rise to <a section-link="empire">the Elven Empire</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="creationmyth">Creation Myth</h2>
				<section>
					<p>In their belief, they were initially created by a goddess, who formed their kin from the bark and leaves of the silverwood tree, a unique and long-lasting species of tree with white leaves and ivory-colored bark that attains a silver shimmer as it ages. As such, these trees are worshipped by them.</p>
					<p>While it is uncertain even to them whether their worship came from the myth, or the myth from the worship, these trees are of great importance to them as a people, having served as their homes and as living sources of material for their crafts for much of their history.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="communities">Communities</h2>
				<section>
					<p>They usually live in large, multiracial communities, alongside beastkins, satyrs, centaurs and other races. Smaller communities do exist, however, sometimes due to slight differences in cultural, ideological or racial makeup.</p>
					<p>Using a <a section-link="traits&abilities">special form of magic</a> similar to <a page-link="schoolsofmagic" section="enchanting">enchanting</a>, they grow buildings and structures out of the trunks and branches of silverwoods and other large trees. They bridge these structures together either by using the same method or by constructing suspension bridges, out of ropes or living vines.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="families">Families</h2>
				<section>
					<p>An elf's family unit usually consists of a male and two "wives", though the term <i>wife</i> doesn't necessarily mean female, in this context. One such family unit will often bear two or more offspring, which the entire community takes part in teaching and caring for. Members of other races in the same community will sometimes form similar family units, though most follow their own racial culture.</p>
					<p>Though procreation between the two wives of a male elf is deeply frowned upon, there are occasions where two male elves will make an agreement wherein one's male wife is allowed to parent a child with one of the other's wives. In this case, the child is considered a progeny of the family of the male wife - the child's <i>male mother</i> - and the head of said family is the child's father. The child's female progenitor is still considered its <i>female mother</i>, however.</p>
					<p>In most communities, a male elf is encouraged to take at least one female elf - or elfin, depending on the community - wife, so as to ensure the continuation of their kin.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="empire">The Elven Empire</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Through their bond with nature and the strong kinship they've formed between nature-attuned races and individals in and around the areas they inhabit, elves have, over their history, steadily expanded their territory and area of influence throughout the west of the continent, giving rise to a veritable, if loosely structured, empire.</p>

				<h1 section-id="traits&abilities">Traits & Abilities</h1>
				<section class="subcolumns">
					<div>
						<b class="title">Physical</b>
						<p><b>Graceful</b> - Though they lack raw physical strength and constitution, they tend to be quite agile, which hints at them having been ambush predators in their earlier stages of evolution.</p>
						<p><b>Longsight</b> - Living far above ground has, over time, pressured them to adapt to see better at longer distances. This has become a hindrance as their empire grew, however, as those with political or scholarly pursuits must wear glasses to read.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<b class="title">Magical</b>
						<p><b>Natural Bond</b> - They are very well attuned with nature, both mentally and culturally. They have a deep respect for all animal and plant life, and an innately good understanding of both.</p>
						<p><b>Magic Affinity</b> - Their strong bond with nature also confers them an innate basic understanding of the Veil, a naturally high capacity for mana, and the ability to more easily understand its particulars.</p>
						<p><b>Woodforming</b> - The name given to a form of magic they've naturally developed. It pertains to the ability to spur the growth of new structures in plants and trees, as well as influence said growth, allowing them to form not only objects, but entire homes, from wood, without cutting trees down.</p>
