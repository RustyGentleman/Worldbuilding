				<section>
					<p>Yet Unnamed is a worldbuilding and writing project set in a medieval-era fantasy world. It was born from a continual development of the character <button page-link="ras">Ras Silverleaf</button>, his home and the surrounding area, and, as such, its development is being done 'from inside out', so to say.</p>
					<p>Though this organic manner of development - and, indeed, the creation of this project - was unintended, I, as a writer, enjoy the idea that each fact, item, being or idea is to be moreso discovered or inferred than purely invented on a whim.</p>

				<h1 section-id="overview">Overview</h1>
				<section>
					<p>The Whisperwood Forest is a large, thickly forested region, comprised of a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees. It is named after the Whisperwood Oak, a rather intriguing species endemic to it - meaning it only exists here.</p>
					<p>Its climate is cold, but not boreal, with fairly temperate summers and springs, cold falls and frigid winters. Though its coastal areas see a fair bit of rain during summers and springs, rainfall diminishes towards more inland areas, some of which may only see rain during the summer.</p>
					<p>A number of villages and small towns dot the region, their formation and survival predominantly owed to forestry, hunting and clay extraction, but also, in smaller part, to animal husbandry. Trade also plays an important role in the increasing growth of these settlements, due to the traffic of people and goods to and from [the large coastal city], a large city in the south coast.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="flora">Flora</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Its size and fertile soil contribute to a fairly large diversity of plants and fungi, while its climate allows for a significant variety of types and species of trees, as well, being home to both deciduous and evergreen trees.</p>
					<p>Below are some notable mentions.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="whisperwood">Whisperwood Oak</h2>
				<section>
					<p>A species of oak known to grow only in this region. While structurally similar to other species of oak, it has a tendency to exhibit various forms of symmetry in the way its branches and leaves grow.</p>
					<p>Its leaves are green during spring and summer, and progressively turn light yellow, orange, and then red during fall, to then turn a dark crimson come winter. Though the tree is deciduous, it retains large part of its leaves throughout winter.</p>
					<p>Its most interesting trait, however, is the growth of thin, stem-like modified leaves along its branches that are able to perform elaborate gestures. Though other types of trees and plants are known to have flowers or leaves that move, the mechanism through which these gestures are activated is unknown, a small number of different gestures have been recorded.</p>
					<p>During spring and early summer, when its flowers blossom, these modified leaves perform a series of gestures throughout the day that generate winds in an upward and outward direction, which spreads pollen towards neighboring trees and up into stronger natural air currents.</p>
					<p>Other series have been recorded, though their patterns or objectives have so far been elusive. Some of them have been known to generate winds as well, but also whistling, howling and murmuring sounds, which give the region its name.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="fluffberry">Fluffberry</h2>
				<section>
					<p>A very common berry, found in most temperate and cold regions in the continent. They are amber in color and of lobular, lumpy shape, which lends them the colloquial name of <i>'cloudberries'</i>. They grow from shrubs that range in size from that of a bush to the size of a small tree, though they are generally about the height of a person.</p>
					<p>The reason for its proper name, and another reason for its colloquial name, is the fact that it is quite airy on the inside, with vacuoles, or bubbles, of air. Despite this, it still is juicy and sweet, which, together with its light weight, lends well to its dispersal mechanism: once the berries have grown and matured, they detach from the plant and float in the air to be carried away by winds and/or eaten by birds, both of which help it spread further.</p>
					<p>Due to its highly effective seed dispersal, it is considered invasive in some regions, though it is also farmed in some places.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="fauna">Fauna</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Hares and deer, as well as small arboreal mammals and some species of rodents, are the most prevalent, being seen in nearly all areas of the region. A variety of amphibians like frogs and salamanders can be seen in wetter regions and near lakes and rivers, where insects are more often seen as well.</p>
					<p>Its predatory population mostly comes down to boars, which appear in the entire region, some species of wolves, which only appear in certain areas, bears and foxes, which will wander in from surrounding regions during fall and winter, and birds of prey.</p>
					<p>Herbives and omnivores seem to thrive particularly well in most areas of the region. Popular local belief attributes it partly to the gestures and sounds that whisperwood oaks produce, though the presence of certain animal species certainly plays a part as well.</p>
				</section>
				<!-- <h2 section-id="whisperwood-ants">Whisperwood Ants</h2>
				<section>
					<p>A species of ant that is thought to have a symbiotic relationship with whisperwood oaks, being, as such, endemic to the region.</p>

				<section>
					<p>Ras is a male, two-tailed kitsune of a towering height of roughly 2m, or 6'8", and seemingly in his late twenties to early thirties, living in a cozy wooden house amidst the woods.</p>
					<p>He is quite a warmhearted and caring person, having a disarmingly calm and gentle demeanor, though he can be witty and playful when comfortable with his company. Though, being true to his kin, he is not above playing tricks on others and putting his silver tongue to use for his benefit, he is good at heart, rarely intending harm with his antics. This puts his alignment somewhere between Neutral Good and True Neutral.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="names">Given & Family Names</h2>
				<section>
					<p>His given name is Ras, pronounced as [ɽɑs], although some may pronounce it closer to "Rasu", or [ɽɑsʉ]. Phonetically, the 'R' in his name is a tap or flap, rather than the English standard, which is a proximant.</p>
					<p>His family name, Silverleaf, indicates his family is originally from the Silverwood forests found in elven territory. That being so, it is not only possible but highly likely that he is some-part elf as well.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="sexuality">Sexuality</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Though saying he is heterosexual would be mostly true, it is not strictly so. It is fairer to say he is attracted to femininity; to soft, graceful forms, whether curvaceous or diminute.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="age">Age</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Despite his appearance, kitsunes age somewhat differently than humans. Although he's often hesitant to divulge his actual age, it's likely that he's in his mid thirties, or perhaps early fourties.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="appearance">Appearance</h1>
				<section>
					<p>His long, wavy hair is kept loose, reaching down to the small of his back. Were it not difficult for him to braid it himself, however, he would. The fur of his tails and ears are, like his hair, pure white in color and quite well-kept, especially for one who dwells in the woods, works the soil and does manual labor.</p>
					<p>His eyes are that of a predator; a deep, bright amber that almost seem to glow under the light of a fire, cut vertically by black slits which shimmer in the dark.</p>
					<p>His claws are, as is common, charcoal black at the tip, fading into clear translucent toward the base, where they fuse into his fingertips. They aid in climbing trees and moving through soft terrain when barefooted. They are not retractable, and, as such, are often worn and dulled from wear, though the ones on his feet often still require trimming - considering it quite a dull job, the less often he must make new boots, the better.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="physique">Physique</h2>
				<section>
					<p>He is exceptionally tall, at roughly 2m, or 6'7" - not counting his ears, which measure at 20cm, or 8", tall. A wiry physique comprised of lean, tough muscles supports it well, allowing him to be quite agile, considering his size.</p>
					<p>His form is mostly owed to the early years he spent doing manual labor at the nearby town, while, through part of it, simultaneously working on opening a clearing in the woods and building a home for himself. However, he only manages to keep his shape through chores, combat training and the occasional adventuring.</p>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="garments">Garments</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Traditionally, kitsunes tend to wear kimonos, even at home, though some prefer wearing robes when in privacy. He can always be found wearing a simple, white kimono, which he owns a few of, and his dark blue obi. He does, however, own a more elaborately tailored kimono, as well as a white and black haori which doesn't get used often, as he usually finds enchanting his current apparel to be denser in cold weather sufficiently effective in all but winter.</p>
					<p>He walks in and near his home barefooted, but wears a pair of sturdy leather boots during longer trips, paired with a belt onto which he attaches the sheath of his blade, as well as pouches, when needed.</p>

						<b>Physical</b>
						<p><b class="physical">Towering</b> - He is exceptionally tall, measuring between 2 and 2.1 meters, or roughly 6'7" to 6'10". Though, thanks to his physique, this doesn't negatively impact his speed and agility, it does make it more difficult to find clothes that fit, or weapons that are appropriately sized.</p>

					</div>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="skills">Skills</h1>
				<section class="subcolumns">
					<div>
						<b>Physical</b>
						<p><b class="physical">Swordsmanship</b> - He is respectably skilled in wielding swords of various types, having a preference for wielding them in one hand while favoring hilts that can accomodate a second hand. Most of his experience, however, is with Grace, a particularly long, double-edged sword crafted specifically for him</p>
						<p><b class="physical">Archery</b> - He is decently skilled at wielding bows, a skill taught by his father and which he hones by hunting. Though he does own a short compound bow, which he brings to adventures and other situations where he may expect confrontations, he often hunts with a longbow for training, which his physique and stature allow him some ease in wielding.</p>
						<p><b class="physical">Crafts</b> - He is adequately skilled in many crafts, out of both interest and necessity - living alone in the woods, the ability to transform raw materials into useful objects, apparel and furniture is indispensable. Such skills include carpentry, woodworking, leatherworking and tailoring, among others. He is quite fond of carving bones, horns, tusks and antlers into pendants and trinkets that often exalt the beauty, form and/or traits of the animal or creature they come from, considering it a way to express appreciation for them.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<b>Magical</b>
						<p><b class="magical">Enchanting</b> - He is exceptionally skilled in this form of emergent magic, which pertains to the ability to alter both the appearance and the physical properties of objects and matter. In fact, he is one of very few enchanters in history to successfully apply enchantments to living tissue, though he is unaware of this fact.</p>
						<p><b class="magical">Sense-weaving</b> - He is highly skilled in this form of emergent magic, more often called sensorial or sensory magic, which pertains to imposing simple sensory perceptions onto other beings, such as sights or sounds. One example of this is Voice Projection, wherein the caster can project their own voice to another's mind, and which he is so well-practiced in that it sometimes takes less effort than actually speaking. This form of magic is limited in scope, but can be quite useful.</p>
						<p><b class="magical">Illusionary Magic</b> - He is respectably skilled in this school of magic, which pertains to effects that change the perception of those who witness the effect itself or whatever object or entity it is cast upon. One example would be the spell that keeps others from finding Ras's home in the woods: when a being approaches a certain radius around it while having the intent of finding his home, it is made to either walk in circles or turn around unwittingly.</p>

				<h1 section-id="belongings">Notable Belongings</h1>
				<section>
					<p><b>'Grace'</b></p>
					<p>A fittingly-named, finely-crafted sword forged by a minotaur blacksmith, given to him as a gift in return for his assistance in a personal matter. It has a long and somewhat thin, double-edged blade that tapers to a fine point, similar to a rapier or an estoc, with a blade measuring about 100 centimeters (or about 40 inches) in length. It has a cruciform cross-guard, with ring guards on either side, and a hand-and-a-half hilt.</p>
					<p><b>Blue silk obi</b></p>
					<p>A dark blue obi made of fine silk which he always wears. It was given to him as a remembrance by his mother before he left to live alone. He was told it was gifted to them by another kitsune family, though by then the occasion for such a gift had escaped her mind.</p>
					<p><b>Embroidered white kimono</b></p>
					<p>An elaborately tailored kimono, white in color, with an embroidered pattern of leaves, also in white, resulting in a subtle but elegant look. It was made by a member of a family of talented kitsune craftsmen at his order, and cost a small fortune. He'll sometimes wear it at home while smoking and indulging himself on anything sweet he might have, though he'll also wear it out on the few rare occasions that warrant it.</p>
					<p><b>White & black haori</b></p>
					<p>A white, thigh-length haori, with a black lining painted in an elaborate bamboo leaf pattern, symbolizing calmness and tranquility. He doesn't use it often, and how he came into possession of it is unclear, though, given its style, it's likely he had it tailored specifically for him as well.</p>

					<h1 translate="no">Kitsunes</h1>
					<h2>Courteous Tricksters</h2>
				</header>
				<h1 section-id="overview">Overview</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Kitsunes are a race of humanoid beings with of large, bushy tails and tall, furry ears atop their heads.</p>
					<p>Compared to humans, their joints and spines are more flexible, but also somewhat more prone to certain injuries. Other differences include claws in place of nails, often charcoal black toward the tip, a somewhat low sensitivity to sweetness, and a tendency towards having androgynous appearance, presumably so as to attract more types of prey.</p>
					<p>At the back of their eyes, in front of their retinas, lies a layer of reflective tissue, called the tapetum lucidum, allowing them to see better in the dark, as well as making their vertical pupils appear to shimmer against the light.</p>
					<p>They are born with a single tail, which splits into multiple over the course of their lives. The necessary conditions for this splitting to occur are still unclear even to them; while some attribute it to epistemological or spiritual enlightenment, others attribute it to expertise in magic, as their already-great magic capacity seems to increase each time they get a new tail.</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="culture">Culture</h1>
				<section>
					<p>Not much is known of their culture; as a race, they tend to keep to themselves, and as individuals, they often avoid subjects involving their kin. Furthermore, of those who know more than what may be considered common knowledge, most are scholars, experienced adventurers and/or individuals who are acquainted with or otherwise have relations with them.</p>
					<p>Most well known are their hunting habits, as they'll sometimes prey upon other humanoid or sapient races, with intent ranging from sport, mischief and entertainment, to attaining or earning servants and mates. Though most would consider this evil and immoral, they often consider it little more than a fun, engaging and rewarding activity. Such hunts rarely result in injuries, and those who fall prey usually enjoy the ordeal, for one reason or another - and, aside from those who are taken as servants and mates, return to their lives as normal, sometimes not even remembering the hunt.</p>
					<p>Knowledge of their family gatherings is only fairly well known due to being one of very few events wherein outsiders are welcomed, and even then, only those who have earned a kitsune's favor, companionship or trust. It is said that, in such events, even dwarves may find themselves strongly inebriated</p>
				</section>
				<h1 section-id="traits&abilities">Traits & Abilities</h1>
				<section class="subcolumns">
					<div>
						<b class="title">Physical</b>
						<p><b>Prehensile Tails</b> - Their tails tails are prehensile, and can be used to push, pull and grasp objects. As their mass of furs makes them functionally akin to an enormous thumb, they're not well suited to manipulating delicate or small objects. They do, however, serve very well as paddles for swimming.</p>
						<p><b>Dimsight</b> - Their vision in low-light conditions is improved by the presence of a <i>tapetum lucidum</i> in front of their retinas. They don't, however, see perfectly well in such conditions, or see at all in complete absence of light.</p>
						<p><b>Predatory Instincts</b> - Being a predatory species, their alertness is always on a hair-trigger; they can become very alert at the slightest stimulus, and tend to be very perceptive. That's not to say they are constantly in fight-or-flight, however - it is simply natural to them. It does, however, make it fairly difficult to catch one off-guard.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<b class="title">Magical</b>
						<p><b>Magic Affinity</b> - Magic comes quite naturally to them, in both understanding and execution, unlike with dragonkins, to whom only the execution comes effortlessly. Consequently, kitsunes are amongst the most innovative and versatile mages there are. Though not all dedicate themselves to the study of its workings, nearly all have some level of knowledge or practice, even if only for convenience.</p>
						<p><b>Foxfire</b> - The name given to their ability to conjure special magic flames, as well as to the flames themselves. These flames and its effects are unique to their race, and can be used as lighting and even as spell proxies, but they are primarily used for hunting prey.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<h2 section-id="foxfire">Foxfire</h2>
				<section>
					<p>Perhaps their most important racial trait and ability, these flames differ visually from normal fire in that they move much more slowly, as though they are viscous or semisolid - as if there is substance to them. They also differ in color per individual, though most come in cool colors. This dominance may be explained by the fact that warm colors may agitate potential prey, thus being selected against.</p>
					<p>Used as the primary means for hunting, these flames incite not heat - they only feel comfortingly warm - but lust and desire, the effects increasing with amount and length of exposure. Prolonged exposure can even induce intrusive thoughts of submission. Kitsunes themselves are impervious to this effect, however; instead, contact with the foxfire of another kitsune can convey vague impressions of its conjurer's thoughts and emotions, and is considered a form of bonding. Such bonding is also possible with those of other species, although it requires mental discipline on the conjurer's part, as it falls on them to alter the effects of their foxfire; the other party, however, cannot reciprocate - this then becomes an expression of trust.</p>
					<p>Foxfire is often also used as lighting, and, behaving as an extension of its conjurer, can be used as a proxy for contact spells and as an anchor for other types of spells.</p>
